# Hackaton-Mistral-Alan

Here is the project I developped during the Mistrail X Alan Hackaton, we had 24 hours to develop a project of our choice mixing NLP and healthcare. 

We chose to develop a app to help athletes build their nutrition plans, our solution is based on Mistral AI API, using a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Langchain.
The user can interactively ask for update in his nutrition plan, the output is fully personalised based on your inputs.
